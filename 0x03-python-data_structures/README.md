0-print a list of integers
. prototype: def print_list_intefer(my_list=[]):
.format: one integer per line.
. you are not allwed to import any modules
. you can assume that the list only contains integers.
. you are not allowed to cast inteegers into strings.
. you have to use str.format to point integers.

1-Secure access to an element in a list
. write a function that retrieves an element from a linked list like in c
. prototype: def element_at(my_list, idx):
. if idx is negative, the function should return None.
. if the idx is out of range return none
. you are not allowed to import any module.

2-Replace element
. Write a function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position
. prototype: def replace_in_list(my_list, idx, element):
. if idx is negative, the function should not modify anything and return its original list
. if idx is out of range, the function should not modify anything and returns the original list
. you are not allowed to import any modules
. you are not allowed to use try/ except

3-Print a list of integers in reverse
. Write a function that prints all integers of a list in reverse order
. prototype: def print_reversed_list_integer(my_list))
. format: one integer per line
. you are not allowed to import any modules

4-Replace in a copy
. Write a function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position (like in c)
. prototype: def new_in_list(list, idx, element):
. if idx is negative, the function should return a copy of the original list
. if idx is out of range, the function should return a copy of the original list
. you are not allowed to import any modules
. you are not allowed to use try/except
